# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning and computer vision projects completed as part of my coursework for the course **Deep Learning with Computer Vision**. Each project implements various computer vision techniques, showcasing practical applications and concepts in the field.

## Projects Overview

### Jupyter Notebooks
- **Canny Edge Detection.ipynb**: An implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm, which identifies edges in images.
- **K Means Clustering.ipynb**: Demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm for segmenting images into distinct regions.
- **Mask R-CNN.ipynb**: Implements the Mask R-CNN model for object detection and segmentation.
- **Object Detection YOLOv8.ipynb**: A project that utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture for real-time object detection.
- **Task 2.ipynb**: Additional task related to computer vision techniques (specifics can be added).
- **YOLOv8.ipynb**: Another implementation of the YOLOv8 model, possibly with different configurations or datasets.

### Folders
- **Basic Tasks**: Contains basic tasks related to foundational computer vision techniques.
- **Harris_Corner_Detection**: A folder dedicated to the Harris corner detection algorithm, which identifies corners in images.
- **Histogram_Equilization**: Contains files related to histogram equalization, a technique for enhancing contrast in images.

## How to Use
To explore the projects:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anushdubey01/ComputerVision-Projects.git
   cd ComputerVision-Projects
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to see the outputs and results of each computer vision technique.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the specific project)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```
